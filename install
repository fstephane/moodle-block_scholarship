In order for students to view scholarships, the following code can be added to the view.php file in the user folder
root->user->view.php

add at line 526 (prior to // Authorize.net: User Payments)

    //scholarship
    if (!$user->deleted and !isguest() and has_capability('block/scholarship:user', get_context_instance(CONTEXT_SYSTEM))){
        echo "<input type=\"button\" value=\"".get_string('userview','block_scholarship')."\" onclick=\"location.href='".$CFG->wwwroot."/blocks/scholarship/user/view.php'\">";
    }

Another method would be to add the sticky block scholarship.
